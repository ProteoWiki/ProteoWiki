# TODO

* Turn into Composer-compatible all extensions
* Check SMW extensions are Semantic MediaWiki orthodox
* Extension for modifying relationships and properties. This should be kept as snapshot for modifying in the future.
** Input CSV -> Generates page that can also be modified. Wiki structure can be changed from there
** Specific Namespace
** Extension should take care about any template or forms involved
** Logic in pages but styling in extension code
